Introduction to Javascript
==========================
	- What is Javascript - ES7 and where we can use it?
	---------------------------------------------------
		- Its a client side lanuguar. But is it?
		- Its lot more then what it used to be. Javascript was designed to run on browsers but its doing lot more.
		- In past to intract with server we used to write php, python where sql queries are executed and data is returned which is presented on browser.
		- We co do it now using javascript too i.e using (NodeJS). Its completly our choose wheather to show user or not.
		- NodeJS is a package which can dealy everything on the server side like writting queries, 
		- ReactJS library for building user interface, which can run on Andriod, IOS etc, 
		- Angular JS one framework for mobile and desktop 
		- Electron : build cross platform desktop apps with Javascript, HTML and CSS
		- Vue JS : Library for designing annimations for web
		- React VR :
		- TensorFlow.js : for training and deploying Machine Learning models.
		
		Java Vs Javascript
		==================
		- Probably the worst decission, ever 
		- What are the similarites between a CAR and a CARpet
		
		ES6/ ES7
		========
		- ECMAScript - European Computer Manufactures Association Script
		- 1995 - Creation - Netscape
		- 1997 - ES1
		- 2009 - 10 - ES5 --> MAP, ForEach 
		- 2015 - ES6
		- 2017 - ES7

	- Getting all tools for Javascript
	----------------------------------
		- NodeJS - LTS Version (Long Term Support)
		- Code Editor - Sublime, Atom, VS Code
		- Browser - Chrome
		- JSBin - Optional - https://jsbin.com/?js,console
				
		
	- Setting up VSCode and Hello world in Javascript
	-------------------------------------------------
		console.log('Hello World!');
		
		C:\VJ-Data\Learning\JavaScript\JS_ExerciseFiles\01_Basics>node HelloWorld.js
		Hello World!
	  
Basic of programming with Javascript
====================================
	- Basic of variable and constant in javascript
	----------------------------------------------
		- varailbe will change where else contant will not
		- varialbs start with 'let' , constant start with 'const'
		
		e.g let 
		
		- reserver a space in memory where I am gone put some value
		- we dont have to specifiy the type to any variable decleration javascript will know based on the value assigned
		- if we provide value in single quote or double quote its treated as string
		- to declare number dont user single or double quote
			e.g let score = 123
		- semi-clone is not mandatory in Javascript
		- dont ever redeclare same varailbe, it will throw error
	
	- Numbers in javascript
	------------------------
		- var score = 100
		  score = 130
		  const bonus = 50
		  var finalScore = (score + bonus) * 1.8
		  console.log(finalScore)
		  var complex = ((4 + 4) * 5) / 2
		  console.log(complex)
		  
		  // temprature conversion 
		  let tempInFaherhite = 33
		  let celsius  = ((tempInFaherhite - 32) * 5 / 9)
		  console.log(celsius)
		  
	- Undefined and Boolean values in Javascript
	--------------------------------------------
		- null, 0 and undefined are all different concepts
		- Boolean - true / false
		
Conditional Programming with javascript
=======================================
	- If and Else in javascript
		if(false){
			console.log('I am inside if block')
			console.log('I am still inside if block')	
		}else if(true){
			console.log('I am inside second if block')
		}
		else {
			console.log('I am inside else block')
		}
		
	- Logical operations in Javascript
	  && - AND operator
	  || - OR operator
	  ! - NOT Operator
	  
	- Var and let keyword - scope in javascript
		- var used for declaring variable 
		- difference between let and var and difference between local and global scope
		- if we declar local variable within a block using var it will be accessable outside the block too
		- dont use var in hihger version, use only if you want to declar as global
		
	- Kings territory probelm in Javascript
		- if we have not decalred a variabel in the global but assign value to variable in local
		- if we try to access the variable in local and outside block in another block we will be able to do that 
		- which is tha major issue it will consider as global, to make it local we need to declar using let inside the block
		
	- Arrays and template literals in Javascript
		- ` is used for templating
		- const superHeroes = ['Iron Man','Spiderman','Captian America','Thor']

			console.log(superHeroes)
			console.log(superHeroes[0])
			console.log(superHeroes.length)
			
			console.log(`we have ${superHeroes.length} superHeroes`)
	
	- 3 must known methods for Arrays in Javascript
		- const numbers = ['one','two','three','four','five']
		
		- numbers[1] = 'SOMETHING' --> ['one','SOMETHING','three','four','five']
	
		- number.shift() 
		  - This will return the first element of the array (one in this case). The array's first number will be deleted
		  
		- number.unshift('SOMETHING') 
		  - This will add the element to first index i.e at index 0
		  
		- numbers.pop()
			- Removes last element from the array and return it element value that is poped
		
		- numbers.push('SOMETHING')
			- This will add the element at the end of the array
			
		- numbers.splice(2, 1, 'SOMETHING')
			- Start with index 2 delete one element and add 'SOMETHING' to the array
			- (2, 2, 'SOMETHING') will delete 2 elements starting with index 2 and add only 'SOMETHING' to array
	

Loops and Function in  javascript
=================================
	- Introduction to functions in Javascript
	-----------------------------------------
		- let sayHello = function(){
				console.log('Welcome to my function')
			}

		  sayHello()
		  
		- let sayHello = function(name){
				console.log(`Welcome to my function ${name}`)
			}

		  sayHello('John') 
		  
		- let myAddress = function(num1, num2){
				let added = num1 + num2
				return added
			}

			console.log(myAddress(3,5))
			let result = myAddress(3,9)
			console.log(result)
			
	- Default parameters in Javascript
	----------------------------------
		- let guestUser = function(name ='unName', courseCount=0){
				retunr 'Hello' + name + ' and your course count is : ' + courseCount
		}
		
		console.log(guestUser())
		
	- ForEach loop in Javascript
	----------------------------
		- const days = ['Mon','Tue','Wed','Thru','Fri','Sat']

			days.forEach(function(day, index){
				console.log(`Starts with ${index+1} -- ${day}`)
			})
		- first parameter of callback function is the array element and second one is the index
		- function without any name is accepted as parmeter of the forEach
		
		
	- For Loop in Javascript
	------------------------
		- for(let i = 0; i < days.length; i++){
			const element = days[i]
			console.log(element)
		}
